    "# Short Breakout Strategy Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tests the **ShortBreakoutStrategy** which implements a contrarian approach to market breakouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy Overview\n",
    "- **Concept**: Short positions on upward breakouts, betting on price reversion\n",
    "- **Entry Signal**: Price breaks above recent high by a threshold percentage\n",
    "- **Exit Signal**: Hold for a specified time period, then close\n",
    "- **Risk Management**: Limited position size and concurrent position limits\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy Parameters\n",
    "- **Breakout Threshold**: Minimum percentage above recent high to trigger entry\n",
    "- **Lookback Period**: Time window to calculate recent high/low\n",
    "- **Hold Time**: How long to maintain positions before closing\n",
    "- **Portfolio Percentage**: Percentage of total portfolio value to allocate for position sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Components\n",
    "1. **Data Loading & Visualization**\n",
    "2. **Single Backtest with Default Parameters**\n",
    "3. **Performance Analysis & Metrics**\n",
    "4. **Parameter Sensitivity Testing**\n",
    "5. **Risk Analysis & Trade Visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's test this contrarian strategy on Bitcoin data!"
